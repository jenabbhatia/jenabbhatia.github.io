Hello all,

The first and foremost step needed in Face recognition is Face detection. Obviously we need to locate the faces in a photograph before we try to recognize them.  Check out my github link, implemented Face detection using python and dlib.  You can install latest version of dlib by using the command: **pip install dlib**

Later i will come up with the next step in Face Recognition.
