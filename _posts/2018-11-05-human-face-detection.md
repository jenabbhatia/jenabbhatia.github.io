Hello all,

Have you noticed that Facebook has developed an uncanny ability to recognize your friends in your photographs? In the old days, Facebook used to make you to tag your friends in photos by clicking on them and typing in their name. Now as soon as you upload a photo, Facebook tags everyone for you like magic: 

This technology is called face recognition. Facebook’s algorithms are able to recognize your friends’ faces after they have been tagged only a few times. It’s pretty amazing technology — Facebook can recognize faces with 98% accuracy which is pretty much as good as humans can do!

The first and foremost step needed in Face recognition is Face detection. Obviously we need to locate the faces in a photograph before we try to recognize them.  Check out my github link, implemented Face detection using python and dlib.  You can install latest version of dlib by using the command: **pip install dlib**

Later i will come up with the next step in Face Recognition.
