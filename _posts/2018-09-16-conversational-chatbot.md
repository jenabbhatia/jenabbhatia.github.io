Hello all,
       Implemented Chatbot with tensorflow in python. Below is the github link:
[ChatBot](https://github.com/jenabbhatia/IntelliChatBot)

Dataset taken is Cornell Movie Corpus. You can try with your own dataset.  Comment, if any improvement is needed. 

Some resources to understand seq2seq model tensorflow:

Soon will come with other dataset and with much more accuracy of the Chatbot.

Happy Coding :)
