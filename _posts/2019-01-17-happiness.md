We all are in a pursuit of happiness.  But do you really think we should run after happiness.

All my life i used to search for happiness, like in school life to have cool girls gang, to travel places with friends and just enjoy. Same thought was in college life and it still continues. May be i was in illusion of soo called happiness, like having such things will bring me happiness. More i ran towards happiness, it seemed farther then it was.

I thought, to be happy i should bind myself with happy, cool  and intelligent people. This is absolutely right, because nobody likes to be with boring , sad, depressive people his entire life.

But just think do you really need to run towards it.?? Why we go mad to get happiness.

Why people is so afraid of spending time alone. ? Why they always search for that someone that will make him/her happy. Why we think to always get connect with that special friend, or a future soul mate.?

Give a pause and just think about it, are you doing the same thing...?

Until we find that someone special, we are incomplete.....do you really think so. No i don't.
We are complete, we dont need that someone to make us complete.
You can be as happy as you are with that someone. Its all matter of thoughts. I am not in favour of do not make friends, and always be alone. My point is we should not be so desperate and run after things and people.

Don't be afraid to be alone, see how it feels to live life without some things or people. 

Why we are afraid to be alone?
We think that some negative thoughts from past will pop up into your mind and keeps on going which is frustrating. But what if your all thoughts are positive, it will be fun right.

Though it sounds simple, its not. But let me tell you, you can not control the outer world of yours, it has both negative and positive part.....right??
