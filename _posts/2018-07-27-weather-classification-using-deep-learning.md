Being a beginer in deep learning, thought of implementing a project with the help of research paper to dive into practical concepts apart from theory.

following is the link of the research paper if anybody is interested.

[Weather classification from images using Deep learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7351424/).

Soon i will put my code in the later post.
